# GitHub Push Instructions

Since we're having trouble pushing directly from this terminal due to credential issues, follow these steps:

## Option 1: Use GitHub Desktop (Recommended)

1. Install GitHub Desktop from: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Open GitHub Desktop and sign in with your SBMGMT account
3. Add your local repository (C:\Users\16308\Downloads\sb-management-v2)
4. Commit any changes if needed
5. Push to your GitHub repository

## Option 2: Use Git with Personal Access Token

1. Generate a Personal Access Token:
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token"
   - Give it a name like "SB Management"
   - Check the "repo" permissions
   - Click "Generate token"
   - Copy the token (it will only be shown once)

2. Run these commands in a new terminal:
```
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME:YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN@github.com/SBMGMT/sb-management-v2.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 3: Upload via GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to https://github.com/SBMGMT/sb-management-v2
2. Click on "Add file" > "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop your project files
4. Commit the changes
